The authors propose that the observed negative correlation between n-hexane/2,5-HD exposure and FSH levels (Figure 4) leads to increased apoptosis of granulosa cells. This is based on the well-established biological principle that FSH is a primary survival signal for these cells, and its withdrawal induces apoptosis. However, the study did not directly measure apoptosis in the exposed women; this downstream effect is inferred from the mechanism and supported by cited animal and in-vitro studies. The evidence is therefore a strong association with a clear mechanistic explanation, but not direct causal proof within the study population.",

The article proposes this exact mechanism to explain its findings, stating, '...we propose that the FSH reduction exerted by 2,5-HD is causing an increased apoptosis in growing follicles at the ovaries from EG participants.' The authors support this by citing established biological principles that gonadotropic hormones like FSH are the primary endocrine factors regulating apoptosis in ovarian granulosa cells (Tilly et al., 1995; Hattori et al., 2018; Regan et al., 2018). Therefore, increased apoptosis of these cells is a direct cause of follicular atresia.",

The paper cites in vitro studies where 2,5-HD (the metabolite of n-hexane) induced apoptosis in human ovarian granulosa cells (Sun et al., 2012) and animal studies showing an increase in apoptotic follicles (Zhang et al., 2013). Since granulosa cells are the primary site of estradiol synthesis within the follicle, their loss through apoptosis directly leads to decreased estradiol production. While the study itself only found a marginal, non-significant decrease in estradiol in a subgroup of exposed women (p=0.059), the underlying biological mechanism is well-established and supported by the experimental evidence cited.",

A trend towards lower estradiol levels was observed in a subgroup of exposed women with oligomenorrhea (p=0.059), which is biologically consistent with a prolonged follicular phase leading to longer menstrual cycles. However, the evidence is weakened because the statistical association is not strong and was only found in a small subgroup (smokers). The study design is cross-sectional, which does not establish a temporal sequence. The authors' primary mechanistic finding points to an association between n-hexane exposure and decreased FSH levels, making the role of decreased estradiol in causing the longer cycles less direct and more speculative based on the provided data.",

A statistically significant positive correlation was found in the exposed group between 'time to get pregnant' and menstrual cycle length (r = 0.507, p = 0.010). The authors propose that the observed oligomenorrhea (long menstrual cycles) is a manifestation of anovulatory dysfunction, which is a common cause of subfertility. They state that 'a longer menstrual cycle could predict a longer time for getting pregnant in women exposed (classified as subfertility)'. This relationship is presented as mechanistically plausible and is supported by external literature cited in the discussion, which describes menstrual cycle length as a 'prognostic factor of subfertility'.",
